     Purpose   : This is the html file to accompany the short project, Drum Kit. The Purpose
                 of the project is to attach background images to buttons, to attach sound  
                 objects to the buttons using the switch statement and to attach event listeners
                 to the buttons. We also attached evenlisteners to the keyboard and used the 
                 switch statement to attach sound objects to the relevant keys to play drum 
                 sounds. Unassigned keys print to the console. Next I added some animation to 
                 flash the keys when activated by the mouse or keyboard.
